# Good Coding Practice

- Readme: Project level documentation
- Dockerfile: describe env
- /doc: More detail
- docstring: a very good way of documentation
- /tests: Test and coverage

## Rules

1. Every time a bug bites you, write a test case, so it won't bite you AGAIN!
2. Before you can think of a test case, do not write your function, because you don't really know what do you want to do yet.
2. When ever a function is larger than 30 lines, refactor it.
3. Keep PEP8 by using `black` and `flake8`.
4. Use virtural environment.
5. Use version control.
