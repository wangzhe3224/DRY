# Do Repeat Yourself, DRY!

Coding is a kind of skill like other skill, such as playing guitar, hence it requires
 *dedicated* exercises to be at coding. This project is for me to plan and keep track
 my coding practice. 

So the idea is, Do Repeat Yourself, aka, DRY!! (Yeah, not that DRY)

But practice and learning also produce pleasure as long as doing it with a plan, so you 
 see the structure and progress.

## Daily

    * Python
    * Haskell
    * Ocaml
    * Erlang
    * C

- Having Fun
    * Tidal Cycle :-)
- Re-invent the Wheels
- Word Problems

- "Low-level" Stuff of Computers

### Languages

I need to pick a main language to express any coding ideas. Python is the one for me. As a main 
 language I need to make sure when I solve a problem, I don't need to think about any syntax or 
 ideal way doing <em>things</em>. The language should be natural to me.

*Again, master a language needs dedicated practice as well.*

I also list other languages here because I used them time to time to finish my master course. And they 
 are so unique and fun to cope with. They provided different views of coding. 

- Haskell: Functional Programming Course
- Ocaml: [CS3110 Data Structure and Functional Programming](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2018sp/)
- Erlang: Concurrent Programming Course
- C: Embedded System Course, [Operating Systems Engineering](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2020/schedule.html)

### Tools

First thing first, coding is about typing text! So master a text editor. But in the end, what
 matters is not which editor you are using, it is the editing logic you are using. To me there
 are only two logics: *VIM and Others*. Why? Vim is about combing editing commands while others
 are about combing key combos. I tried several of them, Emacs, VS code, Vim, and I ended up with Vim. The reason is simple: Vim
 logic is universal. Once you familiar with it, the logic can adapt to other editors/IDEs, while 
 other editors key combos vary quite a lot, and some of them not making to much sense. Some
 of them are too many keys to press.. Your hands stretch. 

Vim's way of editing looks very strange or canter intuitive at beginning. But please do check and
 learn it a bit. Once getting used to it, it make typing and editing so fluent with less effort.

 *Again, using Vim well also need practice. But this one is kind of done in my daily coding exercises.
 It also requires some dedicated learning time to be more effective. ( and pretentiously more fun.)*

### Data Structure and Algorithms

This need a daily exercise in code. 

- [ ] Before and after finish a algorithm, make sure I understand its complexity. 
- [ ] Try in different language as part of language practice
- [ ] Implement common data structures
- [ ] Implement common algorithm (this is some times tie to data structures)

I started with this book `Data Structures and Algorithms in Python`.

### Re-invent the Wheels

Practicing data structure and algorithm is part of re-invent wheels, as I am building something that
 already exist. However, just like practicing music, you start by playing famous and good music, then
 you can create even better ones. Here we talk about the same thing. 

But re-invent wheel can involve more, such as building as small web server, building a database, building
 a compiler, building a graph processing library, or any library you are using on daily work.

Here is a list of wheels:

### Word Problems

This is larger problem solving exercises. 

- [Competitive Programming Tutorials](https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/tutorials/)
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)

### Software Engineering

This about good coding practices to build larger and maintainable software. 

TODO:

### "Low-level" Stuff of Computers

This is about understanding how computer works in a details way. Coding in general is about high level 
 abstractions. 

- [ ] Operating Systems
- [ ] Networking
- [ ] Databases
